        <summary>BTC to moon</summary>
        <p>Investors who hope for a big increase in their cryptocurrency or other asset's value will use the phrase “to the moon.” Since the moon sits high in the sky, the term is a play on other terms such as “sky-high valuation,” “soaring prices,” and the like.</p>
